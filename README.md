# Movement Tracking Mujoco

Movement Tracking Mujoco is a project that demonstrates how to use the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine along with Python to simulate and track the movement of a humanoid model. This project is designed for researchers and developers interested in robotics, biomechanics, or simulation-based movement analysis.

## Overview

This project uses a humanoid model provided by MuJoCo to simulate realistic human movement. It tracks various movement metrics and provides visualization tools to analyze performance over time. The simulation can be extended to support custom movements, control algorithms, or even reinforcement learning experiments.

## Features

- **Humanoid Simulation:** Leverage MuJoCo’s high-performance physics engine to simulate a humanoid model.
- **Movement Tracking:** Record and analyze joint positions, velocities, and other movement metrics.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots and animations to visualize the movement dynamics.
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to extend and integrate with additional sensors or control systems.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**  
- **MuJoCo** (installation details at [MuJoCo.org](https://mujoco.org/))
- **mujoco-py** (Python bindings for MuJoCo)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/17arhaan/Movement_Tracking_Mujoco.git
   cd Movement_Tracking_Mujoco
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have MuJoCo installed and licensed on your system. Then, install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

To start the simulation and tracking, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will initialize the MuJoCo simulation, load the humanoid model, and start tracking movement metrics. You can customize the simulation parameters and tracking options within the code.

### Visualization

After running the simulation, you can generate plots or animations by executing:

```bash
python visualize.py
```

This script uses Matplotlib to create visual representations of the tracked movement data.
