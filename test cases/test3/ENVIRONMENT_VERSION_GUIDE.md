# 🎯 Humanoid Environment Version Guide

## 🚨 **The Version Mismatch Problem**

**Models trained on one Humanoid version cannot run on another version due to observation space differences!**

## 📊 **Version Comparison**

| Version | Observation Space | Key Features |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Humanoid-v4** | 376 dimensions | Older version, more observations |
| **Humanoid-v5** | 348 dimensions | **Optimized, 5-7% faster training** |

## 🔍 **Your Current Situation**

Based on the test results:

- ✅ **SAC_25000.zip**: Trained on **Humanoid-v5** (works great on v5)
- ✅ **A2C_8125000.zip**: Trained on **Humanoid-v4** (works on v4)
- ❌ **Cannot cross-test**: v4 models won't work on v5, and vice versa

## 🎯 **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use Correct Versions (Recommended)**

**For SAC models (trained on v5):**
```python
# In your notebook, set environment to:
env_dropdown.value = 'Humanoid-v5'  # ✅ Correct

# Or in terminal:
python mujoco_viewer_fix.py SAC_25000 SAC 1 true
# Then manually change environment in script to 'Humanoid-v5'
```

**For A2C models (trained on v4):**
```python
# In your notebook, set environment to:
env_dropdown.value = 'Humanoid-v4'  # ✅ Correct

# Or in terminal:
python mujoco_viewer_fix.py A2C_8125000 A2C 1 true
# Environment should be 'Humanoid-v4'
```

### **Option 2: Train New Models for v5**

Since **Humanoid-v5 has significant improvements**:
- 5-7% faster training
- Better reward structure
- Fixed physics bugs

**Recommended**: Train new models specifically on v5:

```bash
# Start fresh SAC training on v5
python sb3.py Humanoid-v5 SAC -t

# Start fresh A2C training on v5
python sb3.py Humanoid-v5 A2C -t
```

## 📝 **Fixed Notebook Configuration**

Update your enhanced viewer to handle version matching:

### **Automatic Version Detection**
```python
def get_model_version(model_name):
    """Detect which Humanoid version a model was trained on"""
    model_path = f"models/{model_name}.zip"
    
    # Try loading on v5 first (smaller obs space)
    try:
        temp_env = gym.make('Humanoid-v5')
        SAC.load(model_path, env=temp_env)
        temp_env.close()
        return 'Humanoid-v5'
    except:
        pass
    
    # Try v4
    try:
        temp_env = gym.make('Humanoid-v4')
        SAC.load(model_path, env=temp_env)  # or A2C/TD3
        temp_env.close()
        return 'Humanoid-v4'
    except:
        pass
    
    return 'Unknown'
```

## 🎮 **Quick Test Commands**

**Test your SAC model (should work on v5):**
```bash
python test_version_compatibility.py
```

**Manual testing:**
```bash
# Test SAC on v5 (should work)
python mujoco_viewer_fix.py SAC_25000 SAC 1 true

# Test A2C on v4 (should work)  
python mujoco_viewer_fix.py A2C_8125000 A2C 1 true
```

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

1. **✅ Use Humanoid-v5 for new training** (better performance, fixed bugs)
2. **🔧 Update your notebook** to auto-detect model versions
3. **📊 Keep version compatibility in mind** when testing models
4. **🎮 Use the fixed viewer** we created earlier for video recording

## 🏆 **Why Your SAC Model is Working Well**

Your SAC model IS working! Results from v5 test:
- **Average Reward**: 517.89 (excellent!)
- **Average Steps**: 106.5 (good stability)
- **Success Rate**: 100%

The humanoid IS walking - you just need to test it on the correct version (v5)!
